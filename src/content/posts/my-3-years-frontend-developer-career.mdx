## Year 0: Before 2020

Frontend development was not my study field. I was studying Electronics Engineering for about 7 years (Diploma & Degree). I was learning Electronics Engineering in diploma with a hope that I could further study abroad with the MARA sponsorship at that time. I'm graduated with an CGPA 3.56 and pass the CGPA requirement to study abroad. However, I got stucked with the IELTS test 3 times. All those 3 test got the same results which is 6, but the MARA requirement need 6.5. I'm cannot afford to take the 4th one and decided to just continue learning with the same field at the same university (UniKL BMI).

During my degree, my study performance dropped drastically. The only courses that I like are related to programming and coding, which are C Programming, Assembly and Verilog. All other courses performed badly and I'm graduated with very bad CGPA of 3.06. This makes me hard to find a good job in electronics engineering field. I was really desperated after graduated, I just take the job as telecommunication technician in a small company. My job that time drilling, installing cable tray in high rise building for the telco equipment installation.

## Year 0.5: Before March 2020

I was not an athletic person. Labour work start taking tolls on my body. I was getting accident due to tiredness that leave quite deep scar on my face up until now. This was really a turning point in my life.
