excerpt: Long ago, I did not know software engineer or software developer is a real deal. I'm not a computer science student. I'm coming from pure science stream at secondary school and pursued electronics engineering for 7 years at university.

As for today, July 2023, I only have around 3+ years experience in software development, especially in Frontend Development. I know I'm still new in this industry and do not have many interesting story, but I want to share what I did before I begin this field and what inspired me to switch the career field from being hard labour to office worker as front end developer.

## Just An Engineering Student

Software developers and engineers typically comes from Computer Science degree. In fact, in 2013, I do not even know the Computer Science degree exists. All I know that time, either engineering or pure science streams like physics or mathematics study.

In 2013, when all my peers already futher their study, I was waiting for any callback from universities and I only got 1 callback which was from UniKL BMI regarding diploma in electrical and electronics engineering.

The diploma also offered the possibility to continue my degree later on abroad, either in Australia, New Zealand or UK. I took the offer with variable loan from MARA. I was doing quite well during my diploma and graduated with a CGPA of 3.56, which academically makes me qualified to further study abroad.

Unfortunately, there was another required from MARA to make sure the student to have atleast 6.5 score in IELTS. I have attended 3 times taking the IELTS exam but all those 3 gave me 6.0 score which makes me disqualified to study abroad. That time, I cannot afford to take another exam.

## Academic Performance Drop

After completing my diploma, I did not think much on my future that time, I just continue to study electronics engineer at the same university as I study my diploma, UniKL BMI. I start to feel lazy to learn hard as I cannot fulfill my dream to study abroad.

During my undergraduate years, the only classes that I pay attention to were those playing around programming like C, Verilog and Assembly. I was doing quite well for Semiconductor Design and Microcontroller classes. All the other classes like Circuit Theory and Math classes, I cannot excel like I did during my diploma.

I was graduating my undergraduate quite bad with a CGPA of 3.06. This makes me hard to find a good and stable job as my first job after graduate.

## Afraid Of Get Left Behind

All my peers, graduated and start getting jobs. Most of them got an engineer job in quite reputable company. I do not want to be left behind at that time. I apply as many job as I can, then I only got a callback from a small telecommuncation company in Kuala Lumpur that do blue collar work.

I really need a job, so I just took the job as telecommuncation technician, which most of my task were drilling the wall, installing cable tray and lay the fiber cable in the high rise building. The job really demanding. I was not a athletic person, more like indoor person. I really get tired easily after work day and night.

## The Turning Point

One day, my boss ask us to work in the morning, then rest a bit in the afternoon. Around 6.30pm, he ask me and my colleague to check out the truck at workshop that has been done repairing or not because at night on the same day, we need to go to Terengganu (around 500+km) to do the job.

On my way back home after leaving my colleague at workshop, I got myself into an accident. The accident happen in motorcycle road. I might having microsleep that time due to tiredness. Got unconcious for about 4 hours and gained my conciousness when I got admitted to the hospital.

My colleagues were the one brought me to the hospital. They, together my boss stayed with me until my girlfriend (now my wife) came to me. When I fully regain my conciousness, my girlfriend brought me to her home and stay in guest room for about a week.

During my stay at my girlfriend's house, I cried and keep wondering that do I need to do work like this until I die. There was no future if I continue doing this thing. Then, my girlfriend suggests me to take a look on programming and software development.

Then, I remembered that I love to code during my study. I tried to find an easiest way to get started in software development field. During this time I found web development was the easiest way to get started.

## First Malaysia MCO

March 2020, first Movement Control Order, MCO came due to high spike of Covid-19 infections. All industries that were not essentials need to be stopped. This include my company. This was a perfect time for me. I studied web development day and night.

The tech stack I was learning at that time only, HTML, CSS and some Javascript. After 3 months doing self study, I tried to apply a few job for entry level frontend developer position. Then, in June 2020, I got a callback from a startup company, REKA Studios regarding frontend developer position.

They called when I just finished drilling a hole for cable tray at Banyan Residences. I got accepted in a few days after the call and the salary offered was very minimum, which was RM 1,500.

I was very excited because at last I found a way to escape the blue collar job. I do not want to do labor job anymore. I want a more stable, consistent and growable career.

## Start A New World

When I write this article, I'm totally grateful to my wife that introduced me to software development. I also grateful to REKA Studios that gave me chances to change my life.

Thank you for spending time reading this piece. I hope this article might give you some motivation and inspiration to keep on pursuing your dream. If you do not have any dream, keep finding. Good luck!
