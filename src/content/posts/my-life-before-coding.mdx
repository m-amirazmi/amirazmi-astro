As of today, July 2023, I have approximately 3+ years of experience in software development, particularly in Frontend Development. I am aware that I am still new to this industry and do not have many interesting stories to share. However, I would like to talk about my background before entering this field and what inspired me to switch from being a manual laborer to an office worker as a front-end developer.

## Just an Engineering Student

Typically, software developers and engineers have degrees in Computer Science. However, back in 2013, I was not even aware that such a degree existed. At that time, I only knew about engineering or pure science streams like physics or mathematics.

In 2013, while my peers were already furthering their studies, I was waiting for callbacks from universities. I received only one callback from UniKL BMI regarding a diploma in electrical and electronics engineering.

This diploma also offered the possibility of pursuing a degree abroad, in countries like Australia, New Zealand, or the UK. I accepted the offer with a variable loan from MARA. I performed well during my diploma and graduated with a CGPA of 3.56, which academically qualified me for further studies abroad.

Unfortunately, MARA required a minimum score of 6.5 in the IELTS exam to ensure that students were proficient in English. I took the IELTS exam three times, but each time I received a score of 6.0, which made me ineligible to study abroad. At that time, I couldn't afford to take the exam again.

## Academic Performance Decline

After completing my diploma, I didn't think much about my future. I simply continued studying electronics engineering at the same university, UniKL BMI. I started to feel lazy to study hard because I couldn't fulfill my dream of studying abroad.

During my undergraduate years, the only classes I paid attention to were those related to programming, such as C, Verilog, and Assembly. I performed well in classes like Semiconductor Design and Microcontroller. However, I struggled in other classes like Circuit Theory and Math, unlike during my diploma.

I graduated from my undergraduate program with a CGPA of 3.06, which made it difficult for me to find a good and stable job after graduation.

## Fear of Falling Behind

While all my peers graduated and started getting jobs, I didn't want to be left behind. I applied for as many jobs as I could, and I received a callback from a small telecommunication company in Kuala Lumpur that focused on blue-collar work.

Desperate for a job, I accepted a position as a telecommunication technician. Most of my tasks involved drilling walls, installing cable trays, and laying fiber cables in high-rise buildings. The job was physically demanding. Being more of an indoor person than an athletic one, I easily became tired after working day and night.

## The Turning Point

One day, my boss asked us to work in the morning and rest in the afternoon. Around 6:30 PM, he asked me and my colleague to check on a truck at the workshop that had been repaired because that night we needed to go to Terengganu (around 500+km) for a job.

While driving home after leaving my colleague at the workshop, I got into an accident on a motorcycle road. I might have experienced microsleep due to exhaustion. I lost consciousness for about 4 hours and woke up in the hospital after being admitted.

My colleagues were the ones who brought me to the hospital. They, along with my boss, stayed with me until my girlfriend (now my wife) arrived. When I fully regained consciousness, my girlfriend took me to her home, where I stayed in the guest room for about a week.

During my stay at my girlfriend's house, I cried and wondered if I would have to work like this until I died. There was no future for me if I continued doing that kind of work. Then, my girlfriend suggested that I explore programming and software development.

That's when I remembered how much I loved coding during my studies. I tried to find the easiest way to get started in the software development field and discovered that web development was a good starting point.

## First Malaysian MCO

In March 2020, the first Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented due to a high spike in Covid-19 infections. All non-essential industries had to shut down, including the company I worked for. It was the perfect time for me to dedicate myself to studying web development day and night.

At that time, I focused on learning HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. After three months of self-study, I began applying for entry-level frontend developer positions. In June 2020, I received a callback from a startup company called REKA Studios regarding a frontend developer position.

They called me just as I had finished drilling a hole for a cable tray at Banyan Residences. I was accepted a few days after the call, but the salary offered was very minimalâ€”only RM 1,500.

I was ecstatic because I had finally found a way to escape manual labor. I no longer wanted to do physical labor; I desired a more stable, consistent, and rewarding career.

## Starting a New Journey

As I write this article, I am incredibly grateful to my wife for introducing me to software development. I am also grateful to REKA Studios for giving me the opportunity to change my life.

Thank you for taking the time to read this piece. I hope this article provides you with motivation and inspiration to pursue your dreams. And if you don't have a dream yet, keep searching. Good luck!
