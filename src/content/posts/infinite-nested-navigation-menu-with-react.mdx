Nested navigation menus are important components or elements for any websites and applications today. They allow for the creation of mega menus in e-commerce applications and sidebar menus in admin dashboard applications. The navigation menu enables users to navigate the entire application with ease, without having to figure out the specific URL path required to access the desired page.

Most applications today typically have 1 to 3 levels of menu listings. However, some applications require more than 3 levels of menus. This is where the concept of infinite nested navigation menus comes into play. Infinite nested navigation menus allow developers to add as many submenus as needed, especially when dealing with complex page structures and deeply nested URLs. They are particularly suitable for dashboard applications or file-based applications.

## Getting Started

Before we start coding, we need to do some preparation and understand the high-level overview of this component first. With a better understanding, we can build a component with a high level of accuracy and easily achieve our target.

### Prerequisite

Make sure you have a basic understand of HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as an understanding of how React works. Here are the tools we need to create this component from the ground up:

- <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/" target="_blank">
    <span>React Typescript with Vite</span>
  </a>

- <a
    href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install/"
    target="_blank"
  >
    <span>Storybook Version 7</span>
  </a>

These two library will be enough to build this component. We will use Storybook because we want to test and make sure our component behaves as aspected. Storybook also allows us to easily document our component.

### Programming concept

To make the nested menu become infinite, we need to embrace the recursion programming concept. We create a function that go through the array of objects which contains bunch of menu items. Below is the example of menu we will be using.

```json
// Menu List JSON
[
  {
    id: "1",
    name: "Dashboard",
    subpages: [
      {
        id: "dashboard",
        name: "Dashboard",
        path: "/",
      },
      {
        id: "multilevel-0",
        name: "MultiLevel 0",
        subpages: [
          {
            id: "multilevel-1",
            name: "MultiLevel 1",
            subpages: [
              {
                id: "multilevel-2",
                name: "MultiLevel 2"
                subpages: [...]
              },
            ]
          },
        ]
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    name: "Settings",
    subpages: [
      {
        id: "user-setting",
        name: "User Setting",
        path: "/user-setting",
      },
    ],
  }
],
```

If the function does not find a submenu item, the function stops and renders the menu item, then continues to the next menu item. If the function finds a submenu item, the function will call itself and create a new branch of calling the same function.

It is hard to explain recursion. Maybe someday I will create an article or a tutorial in detail how recursion works.

### Component Driven Development

As we will use Storybook for this project, we will build the component through Component Driven Development approach, where we will start from small component up to a single component that we want to build.

For our infinite nested menu component, we will need:

- Menu Item Component
- Nested Menu Component

Each component will be placed in their own folder together with 2 more files: `<component>.module.css` and `<component>.stories.ts`. Make sure in our React project, under the `src` folder, we have the following folder structure:

```
├── components/
  ├── menu-item/
  │ ├── menu-item.tsx
  │ ├── menu-item.module.css
  │ └── menu-item.stories.ts
  └── menu-nested/
    ├── menu-nested.tsx
    ├── menu-nested.module.css
    └── menu-nested.stories.ts
```

## Start Crafting

All the prequisite has been prepared. We also understand what we should expect at the end of the development of infinite nested component. Now we can start coding.
