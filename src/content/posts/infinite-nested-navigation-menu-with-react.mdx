Nested navigation menus are important components or elements for any websites and applications today. They allow for the creation of mega menus in e-commerce applications and sidebar menus in admin dashboard applications. The navigation menu enables users to navigate the entire application with ease, without having to figure out the specific URL path required to access the desired page.

Most applications today typically have 1 to 3 levels of menu listings. However, some applications require more than 3 levels of menus. This is where the concept of infinite nested navigation menus comes into play. Infinite nested navigation menus allow developers to add as many submenus as needed, especially when dealing with complex page structures and deeply nested URLs. They are particularly suitable for dashboard applications or file-based applications.
